THE INSTRUMENT MET ALL THE MANUFACTURING SPECIFICATIONS PRIOR TO RELEASE. ¿ INVESTIGATION RESULT / ANALYSIS: THE INVESTIGATION WAS PERFORMED AND BASED ON THE REVIEW OF THE COMPLAINT TREND, DEFECT TREND, DHR, RISK ANALYSIS AND SERVICEMAX, THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE BIOHAZARD LEAKAGE WAS DUE TO A BLOCKAGE IN THE FLUIDIC SYSTEM. THE CUSTOMER HAD INITIALLY REPORTED THAT THE SAMPLE TUBE WAS OVERFILLING TO THE POINT OF LEAKING OUT OF THE INSTRUMENT. THE INSTRUMENT WOULD THEN GIVE A FLUIDIC INSTABILITY ERROR. A PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE WAS PERFORMED ON THE INSTRUMENT AS WELL AS VARIOUS CLEANING PROCEDURES WITH NO IMPROVEMENT. THE SUPPORTING TSR (TECHNICAL SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE) RECOMMENDED THAT THE CUSTOMER CHECK THE WASTE BOTTLE FITTING, DISCONNECT AND RECONNECT THE FLUIDIC HARNESS, AND CHECK FOR KINKED TUBINGS BEFORE PERFORMING A WARM WATER FLUSH. AFTER PERFORMING THE WARM WATER FLUSH, THE CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT THE INSTRUMENT WAS PERFORMING AS EXPECTED WITH NO FURTHER LEAKAGES. THERE WERE NO PARTS REQUESTED FOR EVALUATION AS THERE WERE NO PARTS REPLACED. ALTHOUGH THE LEAKAGE WAS OF A BIOHAZARDOUS MATERIAL THAT POSES THE RISK OF CONTAMINATION, THE CUSTOMER CONFIRMED THAT THEY HAD NOT COME IN CONTACT WITH THE LIQUID AND WERE NOT HARMED IN ANY WAY. ADDITIONALLY, THE LEAKAGE WAS NOT UNDER PRESSURE AND THUS DID NOT INCREASE THE RISK OF EXPOSURE. PROPER DAILY AND MONTHLY CLEANING AND MAINTENANCE CAN HELP IN MAINTAINING OPTIMAL PERFORMANCE THE SYSTEM AND DETECTING ISSUES BEFORE THEY LEAD TO FAILURES, AND CAN BE FOUND IN THE¿BD¿ACCURI C6 PLUS SYSTEM USER¿S GUIDE, #23-18013-01 REV. 1/VERS.

         "!NVESTIGATION THE DEVICE WAS SENT TO BREAS MEDICAL GMBH AND ARRIVED 7TH, OF JUNE 2022. ON THE NEXT DAY BREAS MEDICAL GMBH STARTED THE EXAMINATION OF THE DEVICE. GENERAL INSPECTION SHOWED THAT THE DEVICE WAS HEAVY IN USE. THE DEVICE WAS RUNNING FOR 19038 OP. HOURS AND HAS FIRMWARE 2.16 LOADED. THE DEVICE WAS STARTED AND FUNCTION FAILURE 43 OCCURRED AFTER A FEW SECONDS, INDICATING THAT THE BLOWER DOES NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY. THE ALARM WAS CHECKED, IT WORKED AS INTENDED AND THE DEVICE GAVE AUDIBLE, WITH LEVEL FOR 85DB ±5DB THAT CANNOT BE CHANGED OR TURNED OFF, AND VISIBLE ALARMS. A PRE-USE TEST WITH EXHALATION VALVE CIRCUIT WAS CARRIED OUT, BUT THE DEVICE DID ONLY RECOGNIZE A LEAKAGE CIRCUIT, DUE TO THE BLOWER DID NOT RUN. THE COOLING AIR FILTER AND THE FAN OF THE BLOWER INSIDE THE HOUSING IS HEAVILY POLLUTED WITH WHITE DUST AS WELL AS THE WHOLE INTERIOR. MAINTENANCE IS OVERDUE AND THE INTERNAL BATTERY (SN: (B)(4)) IS OLDER THAN 3 YEARS. THE BLOWER IS NOISY, AND THE BOTTOM CASE IS DAMAGED. THE LOG FILES WERE DOWNLOADED AND EXAMINED WITH THE PC SOFTWARE VERSION 3.3.1.4. THE LOG FILES COULD ESTABLISH THAT TREATMENT WAS STARTED ON (B)(6) 2022, AT 18:40:50 ON MAINS POWER. AT 19:01:17 ERROR #39 (BLOWER DOES NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY) OCCURRED AND TERMINATED ACTIVE TREATMENT. DEVICE WAS RESTARTED IMMEDIATELY BY DISCONNECTING AND RECONNECTING MAINS, STARTING TREATMENT AGAIN BUT ERROR #43 (BLOWER DOES NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY) OCCURRED AT ONCE. RESTART WAS TRIED 10 MORE TIMES BUT RESULTED ALWAYS IN ERROR #43 DURING START-UP. SERVICE OF DEVICE WAS OVERDUE (SHOULD HAVE BEEN PERFORMED IN 2022 APRIL) AND THE FILTERS WERE HEAVILY CLOGGED WITH WHAT APPEARS TO BE A BLACK PARTICLE DUST. THIS SHOWS THAT THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE(WHICH SPECIFY THAT THE COOLING AIR INLET FILTER SHOULD BE VACUUM CLEANED REGULARLY OR WHEN NEEDED) WERE NOT FOLLOWED. CAUSE FAULT TRACING OF THE DEVICE COULD ESTABLISH A BROKEN RESISTOR IN THE OUTPUT STAGE OF THE PSU BOARD THAT DOES NOT POWER UP THE BLOWER RESULTING IN ERROR #43. BURN MARKS COULD BE DETECTED. THE PSU BOARD WAS REPLACED, A PRE-USE TEST AND A COMPLETE FUNCTION TEST INCLUDING CALIBRATION WAS CARRIED OUT WITH NO FAILURE. THE CUSTOMER WILL RECEIVE A COST ESTIMATE FOR THE REPAIR OF THE DEVICE. CONCLUSION AND ACTIONS REVIEW OF THE DEVICE LOG FILES CONFIRMS THAT AN INTERNAL FUNCTION FAILURE 39-BLOWER NOT FUNCTIONING PROPERLY ALARM OCCURRED DURING ACTIVE TREATMENT. AUDIBLE AND VISUAL ALARMS WERE CHECKED AND FOUND TO WORK AS INTENDED. THERE WAS NO PATIENT INJURY. FAULT TRACING OF THE DEVICE COULD ESTABLISH A HARDWARE FAILURE ON THE PSU BOARD WHERE A COMPONENTS COULD BE DETECTED. OWING TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MITIGATIONS THAT ARE BUILT-IN TO THE DESIGN, THE REPORTED FAILURE IS NOT CONSIDERED LIKELY TO LEAD TO DEATH OR SERIOUS DETERIORATION IN HEALTH IF THE EVENT WERE TO REOCCUR. THE DEVICE HAS PERFORMED AS DESIGNED IF A HARDWARE FAILURE IS ENCOUNTERED IN ORDER TO PROTECT AGAINST A FAULT BECOMING A HAZARD. IN CONCLUSION, THE DEVICE HAS ACTED AS DESIGNED AND INTENDED WHEN A SITUATION OCCURS WHICH COMPROMISES SAFE OPERATION, BY TRIGGERING AUDIBLE AND VISUAL ALARM. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE DEVICE WAS DAMAGED, AND MAINTENANCE AND CLEANING HAD NOT BEEN PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE. SERVICE WAS OVERDUE, AND THE DEVICE HAD NOT BEEN CLEANED AS INDICATED IN THE USER MANUAL CHAPTER 7.1 CLEANING THE VIVO 50-COOLING AIR INLET (\"TURN OFF THE VIVO 50 AND PLACE IT ON A DUST FREE SURFACE. VACUUM-CLEAN THE COOLING AIR INLET ONCE A MONTH OR WHEN NECESSARY.\") ALTHOUGH NOT A DIRECT CAUSE, IT CANNOT BE RULED OUT THAT THE EXPOSURE TO POLLUTION AND DUST THROUGH DAMAGED CASE AND LACK OF MAINTENANCE AND CLEANING MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO EXCESSIVE WEAR OF THE BLOWER AND CONSEQUENTLY DAMAGE TO THE BLOWER DRIVER CIRCUITRY. THESE EVENTS ARE CONSIDERED NOT TO BE REPORTABLE PER MEDDEV 2.12/1 REV.8 AND 21 CFR 803 BECAUSE NO PATIENT INJURY WAS REPORTED AND PATIENT TREATMENT HAS NOT BEEN AFFECTED. HOWEVER IT IS REPORTABLE IN GERMANY AS THE INCIDENT HAS OCCURRED DURING ACTIVE TREATMENT. NO FURTHER ACTIONS ARE PLANNED AT THIS TIME. BREAS MEDICAL WILL TRACK AND TREND FOR SIMILAR ISSUES.",

BATCH HISTORY RECORD (BHR) REVIEW: THE BATCH HISTORY REVIEW DID NOT INDICATE ANY DISCREPANCIES. ALL RELEASE TESTING WAS SATISFACTORY, AND NO DEVIATIONS WERE OBSERVED. SAMPLE ANALYSIS: WITHIN THE COMPLAINT INVESTIGATION, RETAINMENT SAMPLES OF LOT 4106193 WERE ANALYZED ACCORDING TO THE QUALITY CONTROL RELEASE PARAMETERS. ALL TESTED STRAINS GREW ACCORDING TO THE SPECIFICATION. IN ADDITION TO THE QUALITY RELEASE TEST PROTOCOL, S. AUREUS MRSA ATCC43300 GROWTH WAS TESTED ON THE BBL¿CHROMAGAR¿ STAPH AUREUS. AS STATED IN THE IFU, THIS STRAIN IS EXPECTED TO GROW IN MAUVE COLOR. THEREFORE, A FURTHER TEST WAS PERFORMED (LOT 4106193) TESTING S. AUREUS MRSA ATCC43300 AND S. AUREUS MSSA ATCC29213 AS REFERENCED ON THE INSTRUCTION FOR USE. BOTH ADDITIONAL TEST STRAINS SHOWED MAUVE COLONIES ON THE ON THE BBL¿CHROMAGAR¿ STAPH AUREUS, AFTER INCUBATION AEROBICALLY FOR 20-22 H AT 35-37 °C IN THE DARK. RETURN SAMPLES HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED. HOWEVER, TWO PICTURES OF PLATES ILLUSTRATING GROWTH OF S. AUREUS MRSA DSM 11729 LOT NUMBER 4106193 WITH TEST DATE 3.6. AND TEST DATE 10.06. AS WRITTEN ON THE PLATES, WERE SHARED. THE RESULT OF S. AUREUS MRSA DSM 11729 WITH TEST DATE 3.6. SHOWED MAUVE COLONIES AND S. AUREUS MRSA DSM 11729 WITH TEST DATE 10.6. THE COLONIES SHOWED NO PIGMENT FORMATION AS DESCRIBED IN THE COMPLAINT. EVALUATION RESULTS AND INVESTIGATION CONCLUSION: AT THIS STAGE OF OUR INVESTIGATION, WE HAVE EXCLUDED ANY SYSTEMIC FAILURE IN OUR PRODUCTION PROCESS. NO DEVIATION COULD BE FOUND DURING THE QC RELEASE PERFORMANCE TEST AND THE PERFORMANCE TEST ON THE RETAIN SAMPLES. BASED ON THE EVALUATION AND ON THE TEST RESULTS, THE COMPLAINT WAS NOT CONFIRMED. IN ADDITION, NO OTHER CUSTOMER HAS RAISED A SIMILAR COMPLAINT FOR THIS LOT NUMBER. WE CONSIDER THE OCCURRENCE A SINGLE EVENT.\" THIS MDR IS BEING SUBMITTED AS PART OF A RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW OF RECORDS DATING APRIL 2023-2025, UNDER CAPA 11910483.",

TOP TEETH WERE WORSE, BUT 1 OF MY BOTTOM TEETH IS A LITTLE LOOSE - LEFT ONE OF 2 FRONT TEETH. I'M AFRAID TO SWITCH AGAIN\" UPDATE  5/13/24: 'MY TOOTH DOESN'T \"\"FEEL\"\" LOOSE - IT IS VISIBLY LOOSE. THE APP DOESN'T SHOW ME MY HISTORY (WHEN I MOVED INTO THE CURRENT SET OF ALIGNERS), BUT I BELIEVE I STARTED WEEK 8 ALIGNERS TWO WEEKS AGO. MY TEETH AREN'T AS SORE NOW, BUT I HAVEN'T SWITCHED BECAUSE OF THE LOOSE TOOTH. I FIRST NOTICED IT FRIDAY NIGHT OR SATURDAY MORNING (B)(6) AND HAVE BEEN TRYING TO AVOID BITING INTO THINGS OR AGGRAVATING IT IN ANY WAY.I'VE ATTACHED THE VIDEO - PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU NEED ANYTHING ELSE.' UPDATE  5/13/24: 'HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN WEARING YOUR CURRENT ALIGNERS? I THINK I LAST SWITCHED ON (B)(6) TO WEEK 8. I WORE WEEK 7 SEVERAL DAYS LONGER DUE TO SORENESS AS WELL. THESE DATES WERE LOGGED IN THE APP, BUT I CAN'T SEE THEM. HOW MANY DAYS/WEEKS DID YOU WEAR YOUR ALIGNERS BEFORE SWITCHING TO THE NEXT STEP? 7 OR MORE DAYS FOR ALL STEPS. AGAIN - I HAVE LOGGED ALL OF THE DATES FOR SWITCHING ALIGNERS IN THE APP. HOW MANY HOURS ARE YOU WEARING YOUR ALIGNERS EACH DAY/NIGHT? I ONLY TAKE THEM OFF FOR COFFEE IN THE MORNING, THEN AGAIN FOR BREAKFAST AND DINNER. I RARELY SNACK OR EAT OUTSIDE OF BREAKFAST AND DINNER - SO MOST DAYS AT LEAST 22 HOURS. ON THE WEEKENDS IF I HAVE A DRINK, IT MIGHT DROP TO 20 - 21 HOURS. HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO USE YOUR HYPERBYTE? HOW LONG EACH TIME, AND HOW OFTEN (BEFORE REACHING YOUR CURRENT ALIGNER STEP)? UNTIL IT TURNS OFF - WHICH I BELIEVE IS 5 MINUTES. I'M MORE CONSISTENT SOME WEEKS THAN OTHERS, BUT I BELIEVE IT'S BEEN ONCE A DAY AROUND 60% OF THE TIME.' (B)(6) 2024 (BST PHONE CALL)- CUST HAS A LOOSE TOOTH AND HAS BEEN IN THE SAME SET OF ALIGNERS FOR ABOUT 6 WEEKS NOW. THEY WOULD LIKE TO GET A REP OF U/L 8 AS IT'S VERY LOOSE AND THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY'LL BE ABLE TO WEAR IT WHEN THAT COMES AROUND. CUST IS CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR TOOTH AND FEELS LIKE THEY'LL HAVE TO REDO WEEK 8 BEFORE MOVING ONTO WEEK 9 (B)(6)- 02784715 \"\" AS YOU'RE AWARE, I HAD TO PUT MY TREATMENT ON HOLD IN EARLY (B)(6) DUE TO A TOOTH THAT BECAME LOOSE ONCE I STARTED WEARING THE STEP 8 ALIGNERS. IT TOOK ME A COUPLE OF WEEKS TO GET SEEN BY MY DENTIST (APPOINTMENT WAS (B)(6), AND SHE BASICALLY SAID THAT DUE TO MY PERIODONTAL DISEASE, I'M AT RISK OF LOSING THIS TOOTH AND OTHERS IF I CONTINUE - AND BECAUSE MY TREATMENT CANNOT BE MONITORED IN PERSON BY BYTE, I SHOULD IMMEDIATELY DISCONTINUE IT. UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S TAKEN A VERY LONG TIME AND MANY, MANY PHONE CALLS TO GET A LETTER FROM THEM AS THE DENTIST I SAW THAT VISIT LEFT THE PRACTICE SHORTLY AFTER. I FINALLY RECEIVED THE LETTER (ATTACHED), AND AM FORWARDING IT TO YOU PER THE REQUEST IN EARLY JUNE. OBVIOUSLY, I DISCLOSED MY PERIODONTAL DISEASE WHEN I APPLIED FOR BYTE TREATMENT, THE PROVIDED PICTURES SHOW EVIDENCE OF THE DISEASE AND I WAS APPROVED. I WAS ASSURED THAT THE TREATMENT WAS SAFE WHEN I EXPRESSED CONCERN WITH HOW FAST MY TEETH WERE GOING TO BE MOVED AND PAID FOR THE TREATMENT IN FULL ((B)(6)) - THEN WOUND UP ALMOST LOSING A TOOTH ON STEP 8 OF 15. GIVEN THAT I AM ONLY HALFWAY THROUGH TREATMENT AND UNABLE TO CONTINUE WITHOUT RISK OF LOSING TEETH, I AM REQUESTING A REFUND FOR THE HALF I'M UNABLE TO USE - (B)(6). PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU NEED ANYTHING ELSE FROM ME IN ORDER TO PROCESS THE REFUND. \"",

THIS CAUSED THE DAMAGE OF THE POWER SUPPLIES OF THE MODULES MENTIONED ABOVE WITH THE PRODUCTION OF FLAMES AND SMOKE. THE POWER SUPPLIES USED IN THE AUTOMATION SYSTEM ARE CERTIFIED FOR THE ELECTRICAL SAFETY AND THE FLAME AUTO-EXTINGUISHED, AS EXPECTED. AS CONSEQUENCE OF THIS EVENT TO RESTORE THE AUTOMATION SYSTEM FUNCTIONALITY, THE WIRES OF THE TRIPHASIC CABLE ON THE MAIN BLINDO CONNECTOR HAVE BEEN CORRECTLY PLUGGED AND THE POWER SUPPLIES OF THE INVOLVED MODULES HAVE BEEN REPLACED. THE AUTOMATION SYSTEM IS WORKING ACCORDING TO SPECIFICATIONS. THE INVESTIGATION HAS NOT HIGHLIGHTED ANY DEFICIENCY RELATED TO ACCELERATOR A3600 DESIGN. THERE HAVE BEEN NO PREVIOUS SIMILAR OCCURRENCES REPORTED FROM THE FIELD. TO AVOID ANY RE-OCCURRENCE, INPECO WILL TEST THE ASSEMBLED GROUP (CIRCUIT BREAKER, TRIPHASIC CABLE AND THE MAIN BLINDO PLUG) BEFORE THE SHIPMENT TO CHECK THE CORRECT TRIPHASIC WIRING SEQUENCE OF THE AUTOMATION SYSTEMS STILL IN MANUFACTURING.

         "AN ABBOTT FIELD SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE (FSR) WAS DISPATCHED DUE TO A CENTRIFUGE MODULE LID THAT FELL WHILE THE OPERATOR WAS PERFORMING MAINTENANCE.  WHILE ON-SITE FIXING THAT CENTRIFUGE MODULE, THE FSR INSPECTED THIS CENTRIFUGE LID, APS CM, LIST NUMBER 07L02-51, SERIAL NUMBER (B)(6), AND FOUND THAT THE GAS STRUTS ON THIS CENTRIFUGE MODULE WERE ALSO WORN, MUCH LIKE THE OTHER CENTRIFUGE MODULE, AND COULD CAUSE THE LID TO UNEXPECTEDLY FALL AND POTENTIALLY CAUSE INJURY.  AN INVESTIGATION WAS CONDUCTED BY INPECO ON THE CENTRIFUGE MODULE LID THAT HAD WORN GAS STRUTS AND FELL WHILE THE OPERATOR WAS PERFORMING MAINTENANCE.  INPECO CONCLUDED THE ROOT CAUSE IS A WORN OUT GAS SPRING DUE TO AGING.  THE SOLUTION FOR THIS IS TO REPLACE THE WORN OUT GAS SPRING AND SEVERAL ACTIONS WILL BE TRACKED THROUGH INPECO TICKET #038952, INCLUDING THE RELEASE OF CO 2749 FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF THE NEW GAS SPRING DEVICE; PN PCR0082 (GAS SPRING) BEING INCLUDED IN THE INPECO SPARE PART CATALOG; AND HETTICH CONFIRMING THE INTENTION TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL STEPS AND THE INFO ABOUT THE FREQUENCY OF GAS SPRING REPLACEMENT IN A FUTURE HETTICH MANUAL.  NO SUBSEQUENT ISSUES HAVE BEEN REPORTED.  A REVIEW OF THE INSTRUMENT HISTORY DID NOT IDENTIFY ANY NON-CONFORMANCES OR DEVIATIONS WITH THE LIKELY CAUSE LIST NUMBER AND COMPLAINT ISSUE.  MANUFACTURING DOCUMENTATION FOR THE LIKELY CAUSE LIST NUMBER WAS REVIEWED AND DID NOT IDENTIFY ANY ISSUES.  A REVIEW OF LABELING AND HISTORICAL DATA WAS DONE, AND BOTH WERE ADEQUATE, WITH NO TRENDS FOUND.  BASED ON ALL AVAILABLE INFORMATION AND ABBOTT DIAGNOSTICS' COMPLAINT INVESTIGATION, NO PRODUCT DEFICIENCY WAS IDENTIFIED.",

NO ERRORS, PHYSICAL OBSTRUCTIONS OR ISSUES WERE REPORTED. WHILE AWAITING A RESPONSE FROM FIELD SERVICE ENGINEER, THE CUSTOMER OBSERVED SMOKE FROM THE SPUR OF THE APS I2SR INTERFACE MODULE. THE FIELD SERVICE ENGINEER (FSE) DISPATCHED TO THE CUSTOMER SITE, DID NOT FIND ANY EVIDENCE OF SMOKE OR BURNING. IT WAS LIKELY THE MOTOR KEPT TURNING THE BELT IN THE DRIVE ASSEMBLY; WHILE THE GEARS WERE LOCKED. THIS LIKELY CAUSED THE BELTS TO CREATE A BURNING SMELL. HOWEVER, THIS COULD NOT BE CONFIRMED. THE ORIGIN OF SMOKE REPORTED BY THE CUSTOMER WAS UNKNOWN. THE FSE REPLACED THE MOTOR, MICROMETERS E192.24.49 AND DRIVE ASSEMBLY ON (B)(4)2021. NO FURTHER INCIDENTS WERE REPORTED. THE INVESTIGATION DID NOT IDENTIFY A REPLACEMENT FREQUENCY OR POTENTIAL SAFETY RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PARTS. IN ADDITION, HISTORICAL DATA DID NOT CONTAIN ANY RECORD OF SIMILAR ISSUES. THEREFORE, NO DEFICIENCY WAS IDENTIFIED FOR THE MOTOR, MICROMETERS E192.24.49 OR THE MOTOR BELT, IM GROUP. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE BURNING SMELL WAS LIKELY THE RESULT OF A HARDWARE FAILURE. CURRENT LABELLING PROVIDES ADEQUATE TROUBLESHOOTING, REPLACEMENT AND VERIFICATION PROCEDURES IN CASE OF HARDWARE MALFUNCTIONS. IN ADDITION, IT DESCRIBES POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS AND PROVIDES THE OPERATOR WITH PRECAUTIONS AND SAFETY MEASURES TO MINIMIZE OR AVOID PERSONAL INJURY OR DAMAGE TO THE WORK CELL WHILE IT IS IN OPERATION. A REVIEW OF TICKETS FOR SIMILAR FOR RELATED ISSUES TO THE CURRENT COMPLAINT DID NOT IDENTIFY ANY ADVERSE TRENDS. NO ADVERSE TRENDS FOR THE APS I2SR INTERFACE MODULE (IM) RELATED TO THE CURRENT ISSUE. CURRENT TICKET IS THE SOLE COMPLAINT FOR THE REPORTED ISSUE. A SEARCH WITHIN CORRECTIVE AND PREVENTATIVE ACTION SYSTEM DID NOT FIND A NON-CONFORMANCE OR POTENTIAL NON-CONFORMANCE FOR REPLACED PARTS.

THE SUPPLIER, INPECO, DETERMINED THAT THE ISSUE IS FROM THE R100 COMPONENT OF THE HETTICH CENTRIFUGE BOARD WHICH WAS TOO SMALL TO WITHSTAND A CURRENT SPIKE. HETTICH RELEASED AN ENHANCED MAIN BOARD REVISION 06 WITH A DIFFERENT R100 RESISTOR. IT IS CONSIDERED ACCEPTABLE TO CONTINUE USING THE AUTOMATION SYSTEM BECAUSE THE ISSUE DOES NOT IMPACT OPERATOR NOR PATIENT SAFETY. THE ACCELERATOR APS OPERATIONS MANUAL AND THE CENTRIFUGE OPERATIONS MANUAL WERE REVIEWED AND SHOW THAT TROUBLESHOOTING AND SAFETY INFORMATION IS PROVIDED. THERE HAVE BEEN NO REPORTED INJURIES FOR THIS ISSUE. IF THE ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS OF THE MAIN ELECTRONICS BOARD FAIL, IT WILL SHUT DOWN THE CENTRIFUGE MODULE. IF THE CENTRIFUGE SHUTS DOWN, THE OPERATOR WILL RECEIVE AN ERROR MESSAGE. THE FREQUENCY OF THIS HAZARD WAS ASSESSED AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THOUGH THERE WAS A TREND IN COMPLAINTS, THE OVERALL FREQUENCY OF LOW HAD NOT CHANGED FROM THE PREDICTED FREQUENCY AS OUTLINED IN THE RISK MANAGEMENT FILE.",

THE SPILLAGE HAS BEEN DETECTED ONLY IN CASE THE ALINITY CI INTERFACE MODULE HAS 3 ANALYZERS SPUR.

A FOLLOW-UP VISIT ON X-RAY WAS PLANNED. THE CUSTOMER CONFIRMED THAT THE INJURED LABORATORY TECHNICIAN WAS WEARING PPE (GLOVES AND LAB COAT) AT THE TIME OF INCIDENT. NO BLOOD ANALYSIS PERFORMED AT THE E.D. THE CUSTOMER THEN SPECIFIED THAT, AT THE TIME OF INCIDENT, THE LABORATORY TECHNICIAN WAS ACTUALLY TRYING TO REMOVE A CAP STUCK INSIDE THE ROBOT GRIPPER, NOT THE TUBE AS PREVIOUSLY INDICATED. ACCORDING TO THE LOG ANALYSIS, THERE WAS A TUBE INSIDE THE ROBOT GRIPPER OF THE CENTRIFUGE MODULE (CM). AS THE LABORATORY OPERATOR HAD TO RECOVER THE ERROR, HE / SHE PLACED THE CM OFFLINE, AND GAVE DIAGNOSTIC COMMAND \"MOVE TUBE TO DESTINATION/TO SOURCE\". HOWEVER, THE OPERATION COULD NOT BE COMPLETED, AND CM RETURNED AGAIN AN ERROR. THEN THE OPERATOR OPENED THE SAFETY SHIELD COVER, AND GAVE THE COMMAND TO OPEN THE GRIPPER. HOWEVER, THE DIAGNOSTIC COMMAND DID NOT WORK, BECAUSE THE MODULE WAS POWERED-OFF, AS THE SAFETY SHIELD COVER WAS OPEN. THE OPERATOR GAVE THE SAME COMMAND 3 MORE TIMES, GETTING THE SAME RESULT. LASTLY, THE OPERATOR PULL THE TUBE, INJURING HIMSELF / HERSELF, SUCCESSFULLY REMOVING THE TUBE FROM THE GRIPPER. ONCE THE CM WAS PLACED BACK ONLINE, IT RETURNED AN ERROR AGAIN. THE INJURY WAS CAUSED BY INCORRECT PROCEDURE FOLLOWED BY THE LABORATORY OPERATOR, THAT SHOULD NOT HAVE MANUALLY REMOVED THE TUBE/CAP. NO DEVICE DEFICIENCIES WERE FOUND.

THE EVIDENCE GATHERED FROM THE LOG ANALYSIS MATCHES WITH THE DESCRIPTION PROVIDED BY THE CUSTOMER AND THE DISTRIBUTOR. THE BARCODE READERS WERE CONFIGURED TO READ ALL THE BARCODE SYMBOLOGIES WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS OF DIGITS NUMBER. THE CUSTOMER IS CURRENTLY USING CODE 39 SYMBOLOGY WITHOUT CHECK DIGIT. THIS BARCODE READER CONFIGURATION DOES NOT ALLOW THE BARCODE READER TO DETECT POSSIBLE ERRORS DURING THE SAMPLE IDS READINGS. THE DISTRIBUTOR FSE HAS ALREADY MODIFIED THE BARCODE CONFIGURATIONS TO LIMIT THE BARCODE SYMBOLOGIES ONLY TO CODE 39. THE DISTRIBUTOR PROVIDED A PICTURE OF INVOLVED SAMPLE TUBES. THE LABEL OF THE SAMPLE TUBE (B)(6) APPEARS TO BE OF VERY POOR QUALITY WHICH MIGHT HAVE CONTRIBUTE TO THE WRONG READING. BASED ON THE PROVIDED DATA, THE INVESTIGATION CONCLUSION IS THAT THE WRONG READING WAS CAUSED BY THE LOADING OF A TUBE WITH A BADLY PRINTED LABEL. IN THE AUTOMATION SYSTEM OPERATIONS MANUAL, IT IS ALREADY SPECIFIED THAT THE AUTOMATION SYSTEM CAN PROCESS SAMPLE TUBES PREPARED BASED ON THE STANDARD AUTO2-A2 VOL.25 NO.29 WHICH INCLUDES ALSO REQUIREMENTS REGARDING THE MINIMUM PRINTING QUALITY.

         "FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF THE CUSTOMER ISSUE INCLUDED A REVIEW OF THE COMPLAINT TEXT, A SEARCH FOR SIMILAR COMPLAINTS, REVIEW OF INSTRUMENT LOGS, A REVIEW OF LABELING AND INSTRUMENT SERVICE. FIELD SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE (FSR) PERFORMED TROUBLESHOOTING ON THE AUTOMATED PROCESSING SYSTEM (APS) CENTRIFUGE MODULE. THE FSR DISCOVERED REPLACEMENT OF THE RELAY TEMPORARILY RESOLVED THE ISSUE. THE FSR THEN REPLACED THE RELAY A SECOND TIME, ALONG WITH THE STARTING CAPACITOR E3267 FOR MODEL 4817 AND 5680 (8-35009891-01) AND RUNNING CAPACITOR E3268 FOR MODEL 4817 AND 5680 (8-35009892-01). THIS RESOLVED THE ISSUE COMPLETELY AND THE MODULE FUNCTIONED AS INTENDED. A REVIEW OF THE RISK REDUCTION FOR SAFETY HAZARDS MEMO INDICATES ABBOTT DIAGNOSTIC EQUIPMENT AND ACCESSORIES ARE CERTIFIED TO THE APPROPRIATE SAFETY STANDARDS AND THE OPERATOR IS PROTECTED AGAINST ELECTRIC SHOCK AND THE SPREAD OF FIRE FROM THE EQUIPMENT. A REVIEW OF TRACKING AND TRENDING FOR THE HETTICH 5680 MAIN ELECTRONICS BOARD DID NOT FIND OTHER COMPLAINTS RELATED TO THE CUSTOMER'S ISSUE AND NO TRENDS WERE IDENTIFIED. LABELING WAS REVIEWED AND FOUND TO BE ADEQUATE. BASED ON THE INVESTIGATION, NO SYSTEMIC ISSUE OR DEFICIENCY OF THE AUTOMATED PROCESSING SYSTEM (APS) CENTRIFUGE MODULE OR STARTING CAPACITOR E3267 FOR MODEL 4817 AND 5680 AND RUNNING CAPACITOR E3268 FOR MODEL 4817 AND 5680 WAS IDENTIFIED.",

         "A CUSTOMER OUTSIDE US REPORTED A SAMPLE TUBE ID MISMATCH OCCURRED AT THE CENTRIFUGE MODULE WHICH CONNECTS THE AUTOMATION SYSTEM TRACK TO THE THIRD PARTY'S CENTRIFUGE. THE INVOLVED SAMPLE TUBES WERE A TUBE WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN DIVERTED INTO THE CENTRIFUGE MODULE BUT REMAINED ON THE MAIN TRACK (TUBE A) AND A SAMPLE TUBE LOADED INTO THE CENTRIFUGE (TUBE B). THE CARRIER WHICH WAS PHYSICALLY TRANSPORTING TUBE A WAS ERRONEOUSLY ASSOCIATED TO TUBE B. TUBE A WAS FLAGGED WITH ERROR SC06D \"TUBE LOST IN PICK AND PLACE MODULE\". THE REAL TUBE A WAS SENT TO THE ANALYZERS TO BE TESTED ACCORDING TO THE TEST ORDERS RECEIVED FOR TUBE B. THE TEST ORDERED FOR TUBE B SHOULD HAVE BEEN EXECUTED ON A CENTRIFUGED SAMPLE (SERUM OR PLASMA) WHILE TUBE A WAS STILL A WHOLE BLOOD SAMPLE. THE OBTAINED RESULTS WERE OUT OF NORMAL RANGE. THE SAMPLE TUBE WAS SORTED IN A RACK OF IOM#2. WHEN THE OPERATOR PERFORMED THE VISUAL CHECK ON THE SAMPLE BEFORE RE-RUN, HE BECAME AWARE OF THE SID MISMATCH ISSUE. HE BLOCKED THE RESULTS OBTAINED FROM TUBE A. WHEN THE REAL TUBE B WAS THEN RELEASED BY THE CENTRIFUGE MODULE, IT WAS FLAGGED AS DUPLICATE (SC00E) AND UNLOADED INTO THE PRIORITY OUTPUT RACK DEDICATED TO SAMPLE TUBES WITH ERROR MESSAGES AT THE INPUT OUTPUT MODULE (IOM#1) TO BE MANUALLY MANAGED BY THE OPERATORS. BOTH TUBE A AND TUBE B WERE RE-CENTRIFUGED IN A STANDALONE CENTRIFUGE AND THE SAMPLES WERE MANUALLY PLACED INTO THE ANALYZER FOR THE ASSAYS RUN. ACCORDING TO THE PROVIDED INFORMATION THERE WERE NO IMPACTS ON THE INVOLVED PATIENTS: NO MEDICATION NOR TREATMENT WAS DELAYED OR CANCELLED.",

         "A SAMPLE TUBE GOT STUCK INSIDE THE ROBOT GRIPPER OF THE RACK INPUT MODULE (RIM) WHICH IS AN AUTOMATION SYSTEM MODULE WHICH ALLOWS THE MOVEMENT OF SAMPLE TUBES FROM A RACK TO THE AUTOMATION SAMPLE CARRIERS. WHEN THE GRIPPER TRIED TO PLACE THE TUBE INTO THE CARRIER THE ERROR ON THE UP-DOWN ROBOT MOVEMENT WAS GENERATED AND THE MODULE STOPPED WORKING. THE ERROR RECOVERY REQUIRED THE INTERVENTION ON THE MODULE AND THE CUSTOMER CONTACTED THE SERVICE ASSISTANCE. THE INVOLVED TUBE WAS A SQUARE BASE TUBE WHICH IS NOT ALLOWED ON THE AUTOMATION SYSTEM: THE TUBE WAS ERRONEOUSLY PLACED INTO THE RACK LOADED IN THE RIM BY THE OPERATOR. THE FIELD SERVICE ENGINEER REMOVED THE SAFETY COVER AND TRIED TO PULL THE TUBE OUT OF THE GRIPPER. DOING SO, HE CUT HIS FINGER WITH THE GRIPPER FINGERS. HE WAS WEARING PPE, INCLUDING GLOVES. THE CUT DID NOT REQUIRE ANY MEDICAL TREATMENT. A BLOOD TEST WAS PERFORMED THE DAY AFTER THE INCIDENT: ALL TEST RESULTS WERE NEGATIVE. THE BLOOD TESTS WILL BE REPEATED AFTER 1 MONTH, 3 MONTHS, 6 MONTHS AND 12 MONTHS.",

THE OPERATIONS MANUAL ALREADY SPECIFIES WHICH TYPES OF SAMPLE TUBES ARE ALLOWED ON THE AUTOMATION SYSTEM. IN THE OPERATIONS MANUAL AND SERVICE MANUAL, IT HAS ALREADY RECOMMENDED TO USE CAUTION WHEN ACCESSING PARTS OF THE MODULE NORMALLY PROTECTED BY COVERS SINCE SHARP SURFACES CAN BE REACHED. THE FIELD SERVICE ENGINEER REPEATED THE BLOOD TESTS AFTER 1 MONTH, 3 MONTHS, 6 MONTHS AND 12 MONTHS. ON JANUARY 14TH, 2021 HE CONFIRMED THE RESULTS WERE NEGATIVE FOR INFECTIONS. THE EVENT HAS BEEN CONSIDERED AS A HUMAN ERROR AND NO DESIGN CHANGES ARE FORESEEN.",

         "THE INITIAL REPORT WAS SUBMITTED ON JANUARY 12TH, 2022. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: THE LOG ANALYSIS CONFIRMED THAT THE CARRIER WAS DIVERTED INTO THE CENTRIFUGE MODULE WITH SAMPLE TUBE \"A\" AND THEN IT WAS RELEASED INTO THE MAIN LANE WITH ANOTHER SAMPLE TUBE \"B\" ASSOCIATED, BUT STILL TUBE \"A\" PHYSICALLY ON IT. HOWEVER, THE TIME STAMPS IN THE LOG FILES ARE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE TIMING NEEDED BY THE CARRIER TO PHYSICALLY COVER THE SPACE BETWEEN THE PREVIOUS NODE (WHEN THE CARRIER IS LOGICALLY ENQUEUED INTO THE CENTRIFUGE MODULE) AND THE CENTRIFUGE MODULE LOAD GATE WHERE THE CARRIERS ARE RELEASED BACK INTO THE MAIN LANE. IT HAS NOT BEEN POSSIBLE TO REPRODUCE THE SCENARIO IN HOUSE NOR TO DETERMINE THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE EVENT. FROM THE FIELD THE CUSTOMER DID NOT REPORT ANY OTHER OCCURRENCES. NO SIMILAR COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED FROM OTHER SITES. THE INVESTIGATION OUTCOME IS THAT THE PROBLEM IN NOT REPRODUCIBLE. FURTHER EVALUATIONS WILL BE DONE IN CASE OF NEW EVIDENCE/INFORMATION FROM THE FIELD.",
