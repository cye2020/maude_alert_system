    "Read the entire MDR text and product_problem field to understand:\n",
    "- What happened? (observable symptoms)\n",
    "- What failed? (components/functions)\n",
    "- What was the outcome? (patient impact)\n",
    "- What did manufacturer find? (investigation results)\n",
    "\n",
    "### STEP 2: PATIENT HARM CLASSIFICATION\n",
    "Apply strict criteria:\n",
    "- **Death**: Explicitly states patient died\n",
    "- **Serious Injury**: Required medical intervention, hospitalization, or permanent impairment\n",
    "- **Minor Injury**: Temporary discomfort, minimal intervention needed\n",
    "- **No Harm**: Explicitly states no patient harm OR only device malfunction mentioned\n",
    "- **Unknown**: ONLY if report provides absolutely no patient outcome information\n",

    "Decision Logic:\n",
    "- IF text mentions patient outcome → classify accordingly\n",
    "- IF only device issue described + no harm mentioned → \"No Harm\"\n",
    "- IF text says \"no adverse event\" or \"no patient injury\" → \"No Harm\"\n",

    "- Hardware: battery, circuit board, sensor, cable, connector, display, pump, valve, tubing\n",

    "\n",
    "Rules:\n",
    "- Extract exact component names mentioned\n",
    "- Prioritize components directly related to the failure\n",
    "- Use singular form (e.g., \"battery\" not \"batteries\")\n",

    "2. **Software/Display Issue?**\n",
    "   - Keywords: error code, frozen screen, crashed, unresponsive interface, software error\n",
    "   - → Software/Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Measurement/Reading Wrong?**\n",
    "   - Keywords: inaccurate reading, wrong value, measurement error, calibration issue\n",
    "   - → Sensor/Accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Physical Breakage?**\n",
    "   - Keywords: broke, cracked, fractured, separated, leak, ruptured, detached\n",
    "   - → Mechanical/Structural\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Core Function Failed?**\n",
    "   - Keywords: stopped working, didn't deliver, failed to perform, no output\n",
    "   - → Functional Failure\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Alarm System Issue?**\n",
    "   - Keywords: alarm didn't sound, false alarm, alarm failure\n",
    "   - → Alarm/Alert\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Connection/Data Transfer Failed?**\n",
    "   - Keywords: connection lost, wireless failed, Bluetooth issue, data didn't transfer\n",
    "   - → Communication/Connectivity\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Sterility/Foreign Matter?**\n",
    "   - Keywords: contamination, non-sterile, particles, debris\n",
    "   - → Sterility/Contamination\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Wrong Label/Package?**\n",
    "   - Keywords: mislabeled, wrong documentation, packaging damaged\n",
    "   - → Labeling/Packaging\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Design Caused User Error?**\n",
    "    - Keywords: confusing design, look-alike parts, poor usability\n",
    "    - → User/Human Factor\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Environmental/Compatibility?**\n",
    "    - Keywords: temperature issue, humidity, incompatible accessory\n",
    "    - → Environmental/Compatibility\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **None of Above BUT Clearly Described?**\n",
    "    - → Other\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **Text Says \"Unknown Cause\" OR Zero Symptom Info?**\n",
    "    - → Unknown (LAST RESORT ONLY)\n",
    "\n",
    "**STEP 5C: VERIFICATION CHECK**\n",
    "Ask yourself:\n",
    "- \"Does this classification match the ROOT CAUSE (not just surface symptom)?\"\n",
    "- \"Did I thoroughly check all 12 categories before selecting Unknown?\"\n",
    "- \"Is there ANY symptom I can infer the defect type from?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.2 UNKNOWN USAGE RESTRICTION\n",
    "Use \"Unknown\" ONLY when ALL these conditions are met:\n",
    "- [ ] Text explicitly states \"cause unknown\" or \"under investigation with no findings\"\n",
    "- [ ] Zero observable symptoms described\n",
    "- [ ] No inference possible from context\n",
    "\n",
    "REJECT Unknown if:\n",
    "- Any symptom is mentioned (even vague ones like \"stopped working\")\n",
    "- product_problem field contains specific defect types\n",
    "- Context suggests probable cause\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.3 CLASSIFICATION EXAMPLES\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1 - Power Issue:\n",
    "Input: \"Device wouldn't power on after battery fully charged\"\n",
    "STEP 5A: Symptoms = won't power on, battery mentioned\n",
    "STEP 5B: Decision tree #1 matches → Electrical/Power\n",
    "STEP 5C: Verified - root cause is power system failure\n",
    "OUTPUT: Electrical/Power\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2 - Vague but Classifiable:\n",
    "Input: \"Pump stopped delivering medication\"\n",
    "STEP 5A: Symptom = core function failure (not delivering)\n",
    "STEP 5B: Decision tree #5 matches → Functional Failure\n",
    "STEP 5C: Verified - primary function didn't work\n",
    "OUTPUT: Functional Failure (NOT Unknown!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 3 - Multi-symptom:\n",
    "Input: \"Display showed error E-203, then device overheated and shut down\"\n",
    "STEP 5A: Symptoms = error code (software) + overheating (power)\n",
    "STEP 5B: TWO categories match, but overheating is PRIMARY danger\n",
    "STEP 5C: Root cause = thermal/power issue\n",
    "OUTPUT: Electrical/Power\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 4 - Legitimate Unknown:\n",
    "Input: \"Device malfunctioned during procedure, cause under investigation, no findings yet\"\n",
    "STEP 5A: Zero specific symptoms provided\n",
    "STEP 5B: Cannot map to any category\n",
    "STEP 5C: Genuinely no information\n",
    "OUTPUT: Unknown (acceptable case)\n",
    "\n",
    "### STEP 6: DEFECT CONFIRMATION DECISION\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply this logic (check in order):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **IF manufacturer explicitly confirmed defect** → defect_confirmed = true (1)\n",
    "2. **IF you classified defect_type as specific category (NOT \"Unknown\" or \"Other\")** → defect_confirmed = true (1)\n",
    "3. **IF text says \"no defect found\" or \"functioning normally\"** → defect_confirmed = false (0)\n",
    "4. **IF defect_type is \"Unknown\" AND no manufacturer conclusion** → defect_confirmed = null (None)\n",
    "\n",
    "Null Minimization Rule:\n",
    "- Use null ONLY when genuinely zero information exists about defect confirmation\n",
    "- If you successfully classified defect_type (Steps 5A-5C), you have enough info → set to true\n",
    "\n",
    "### STEP 7: INSPECTION ACTIONS EXTRACTION\n",
    "\n",
    "Summarize manufacturer's findings/actions:\n",
    "- What tests were conducted?\n",
    "- What was discovered?\n",
    "- What corrective actions taken?\n",
    "\n",
    "IF no investigation mentioned:\n",
    "- \"No inspection reported\" (if truly absent)\n",

    "\n",
    "### Phase 1: Accuracy Review\n",
    "- [ ] Did I check ALL 12 defect categories before using \"Unknown\"?\n",
    "- [ ] Did I infer patient_harm from context (not just explicit statements)?\n",
    "- [ ] Did I set defect_confirmed=true if I classified defect_type successfully?\n",
    "- [ ] Is incident_summary factual and concise (<200 chars)?\n",
    "- [ ] Did I extract actual component names (not generic terms)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 2: Constraint Compliance\n",
    "- [ ] Is defect_type \"Unknown\" only because text says \"unknown\" or has zero symptoms?\n",
    "- [ ] Is defect_confirmed null only because truly no information exists?\n",
    "- [ ] Did I remove any emojis from extracted text?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 3: Quality Check\n",
    "- [ ] Would a medical device safety expert agree with my classification?\n",
    "- [ ] Did I prioritize root cause over surface symptoms?\n",
    "- [ ] Is my output consistent with the symptom-to-defect mapping?\n",
    "\n",
    "IF any checkbox is unchecked → REVISE before outputting\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## CRITICAL REMINDERS\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inference Over Uncertainty**: When symptoms exist, infer the defect type rather than defaulting to \"Unknown\"\n",
    "2. **Defect Confirmation Logic**: If you classified defect_type (not Unknown/Other), set defect_confirmed=true\n",
    "3. **Context Utilization**: Use product_problem field as supporting evidence\n",
