    "- **Minor Injury**: Temporary/minor injury requiring minimal intervention\n",
    "- **Serious Injury**: Significant injury requiring medical intervention\n",
    "- **Death**: Patient death occurred\n",

    "- **Mechanical/Structural**: Physical component breakage, wear, or structural damage\n",
    "- **Electrical/Power**: Electrical malfunction, power loss, short circuit, or battery issues\n",
    "- **Software/Interface**: Software bugs, crashes, freezing, or UI malfunctions\n",
    "- **Alarm/Alert**: Alarm failed to activate, false alarms, or alert system issues\n",
    "- **Sensor/Accuracy**: Inaccurate readings, sensor malfunction, or calibration issues\n",
    "- **Communication/Connectivity**: Data transfer issues, wireless connectivity problems\n",
    "- **Labeling/Packaging**: Incorrect labels, damaged packaging, or missing instructions\n",
    "- **Sterility/Contamination**: Sterility breach or contamination detected\n",
    "- **User/Human Factor**: Misuse, user error, or design issues causing user confusion\n",
    "- **Environmental/Compatibility**: Issues due to temperature, humidity, or device incompatibility\n",
    "- **Other**: Use only when defect clearly doesn't fit other categories\n",

THERE ARE SUCTION ALARMS AND IMPELLA POSITION UNKNOWN ALARMS THROUGHOUT THE FIRST 2 HOURS OF THE CASE. DATA LOGS ARE MISSING THE LAST 4 HOURS OF THE CASE INCLUDING THE PUMP STOP. DATA LOGS ALSO SHOW MOTOR CURRENT SPIKES PRIOR TO THE EVENT. UPON INVESTIGATION OF THE PUMP, A LARGE CLOT WAS OBSERVED IN THE INFLOW CAGE. THE SATURATED FLOW AND PUMP STOP WERE ABLE TO BE REPRODUCED IN THE LAB. AS THE PUMP WAS PURGED, CLOTS WERE EXPELLED, AND THE SATURATED FLOW RESOLVED. THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE PUMP STOP WAS DETERMINED TO BE BIOMATERIAL PREVENTING THE MOTOR FROM BEING PROTECTED WITH PURGE FLUID AND EVENTUALLY LEADING TO A PUMP STOP AND SATURATED FLOW.\nTHE IMPELLA DEVICE WAS NOT RECEIVED FROM THE CUSTOMER AND THEREFORE, AN EVALUATION OF THE DEVICE WAS NOT POSSIBLE. UPON INVESTIGATION CLOSURE, A SUPPLEMENTAL MDR WILL BE FILED. INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE FOR THE RELATED EVENT ARE AS FOLLOWS: ¿MAINTAINING ACT AT OR ABOVE 250 SECONDS WILL HELP PREVENT A THROMBUS FROM ENTERING THE CATHETER AND CAUSING A SUDDEN STOP ON STARTUP.¿ ¿UNRESOLVED PURGE PRESSURE HIGH ALARM IF NOT RESOLVED BY THE RECOMMENDATIONS PROVIDED, HIGH PURGE PRESSURE¿WHICH TRIGGERS THE ¿PURGE PRESSURE HIGH¿ ALARM MESSAGE¿COULD BE AN INDICATION OF A KINK IN THE IMPELLA CATHETER. IN THIS CASE, THE MOTOR IS NO LONGER BEING PURGED AND MAY EVENTUALLY STOP.¿ ¿IMPELLA STOPPED IF THE IMPELLA CATHETER HAS STOPPED SUDDENLY: 1. TRY TO RESTART THE CATHETER AT PREVIOUS P-LEVEL. 2. IF THE IMPELLA DOES NOT RESTART, TRY TO RESTART AT P-2. 3. IF THE IMPELLA DOES NOT RESTART OR STOPS AGAIN, WAIT 1 MINUTE AND TRY TO RESTART AGAIN. 4. IF THE IMPELLA RESTARTS, WEAN DOWN TO P-2 AS THE PATIENT CAN TOLERATE. UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, CATHETER FUNCTION IS NOT RELIABLE AND THE IMPELLA MAY STOP AGAIN. 5. IF THE IMPELLA DOES NOT RESTART, REMOVE THE IMPELLA FROM THE VENTRICLE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO AVOID AORTIC INSUFFICIENCY.¿\nTHE USER FACILITY REPORTED A (B)(6) FEMALE UNDERGOING CARDIAC SURGERY WAS IMPLANTED WITH AN IMPELLA DEVICE FOR MECHANICAL CIRCULATORY SUPPORT. US COMPLAINANT REPORTED THE PATIENT WAS ON IMPELLA 5.5 SUPPORT AND AFTER PLACEMENT, THERE WAS LOW FLOWS NOTICED. THE IMPELLA WAS REPOSITIONED, AND FLOWS IMPROVED, HOWEVER AFTER LIFTING UP THE HEART AGAIN, LV WAVEFORM STARTED TO GO UP ABOUT AORTIC PLACEMENT SIGNAL, AND FLOWS APPEARING SATURATED. TWO HOURS LATER, MC STARTED TO GRADUALLY INCREASE. THE DECISION WAS MADE TO REMOVE THE PUMP, AND JUST BEFORE REMOVAL, THE PUMP STOPPED. THE IMPELLA WAS REMOVED.",
